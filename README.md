This project is a starter kit for building knowledge base-powered chatbots using FinClip and finclip-agent. It provides all the necessary setup and configuration tools to quickly deploy an agent with custom knowledge. The frontend chat interface can be embedded as a floating window on websites, and the backend is an Agent based on [finclip-agent](https://github.com/Geeksfino/finclip-agent).

**Important**: When creating your own agent, make sure to follow the strict YAML format requirements for the `brain.md` file as specified in the [finclip-agent documentation](https://github.com/Geeksfino/finclip-agent#agent-brain). The file must only contain the top-level fields: `name`, `role`, `goal`, and `capabilities`. Any other structure will prevent the agent from starting correctly.

## Getting Started

The setup script will automatically check for and install required dependencies. You only need:

- A Unix-like environment (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or higher (the setup script will detect but not install Python)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Geeksfino/finclip-agent-starterkit.git
cd finclip-agent-starterkit

# Run the environment setup script (automatically detects and installs dependencies)
bun setup:env

# Copy sample files to the contents directory (optional)
bun run kb:use-samples

# Build the knowledge base (creates kb.tar.gz)
bun run kb:package

# Configure your API key in .agent.env (REQUIRED)
# Edit the .agent.env file and add your LLM API key

# Start the agent
bun start

# Verify the agent is working with the inspector UI
bun start --inspect
```

## Environment Setup

### Automatic Setup

The easiest way to set up your environment is to run:

```bash
bun setup:env
```

This script will:
1. Check for and install Bun if not already available
2. Verify Python is installed (you'll need to install Python manually if it's not found)
3. Install all necessary dependencies
4. Create a Python virtual environment
5. Install kb-mcp-server
6. Download required models
7. Generate configuration files

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run each step manually:

1. Set up dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun run setup
   ```

2. Download required models:
   ```bash
   bun run download-models
   ```

3. Generate configuration:
   ```bash
   bun run generate-config
   ```

## Configuration

After setup, you'll need to:

1. Edit `.agent.env` with your API key and other settings (REQUIRED)
   ```
   # Example .agent.env configuration
   LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here        # Replace with your actual API key
   LLM_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o                    # Or another model of your choice
   LLM_STREAM_MODE=true
   ```
2. Optionally edit `brain.md` to customize your agent's behavior

> **Note**: The `conf/preproc-mcp.json` file contains paths specific to your local environment and is automatically generated by the setup process. It should not be manually edited or committed to version control.

## Sample Knowledge Base Content

This starter kit comes with sample markdown files in the `knowledge-samples` directory covering topics like data science, machine learning, neural networks, and NLP. This allows you to quickly build a working knowledge base for testing before adding your own content.

### Using the Sample Files

To use the provided sample files:

```bash
# Copy the sample files to the contents directory
bun run kb:use-samples

# Build the knowledge base (creates kb.tar.gz)
bun run kb:package
```

### Building the Knowledge Base

1. After copying the sample files to the `contents` directory, they will be used when you run the knowledge base build commands
2. To generate the knowledge base, run `bun run kb:package`
3. The knowledge base will be built according to the settings in `kb.yml` in the root directory
4. Once built, you can test the knowledge base by running `bun run kb:search "your search query"` to search for information

### Customizing with Your Own Content

When you're ready to customize the chatbot with your own knowledge:

1. Place your own markdown, PDF, or other supported documents in the `contents` directory
2. Adjust the settings in `kb.yml` if needed (e.g., chunking strategy, embedding model)
3. Rebuild the knowledge base with `bun run kb:package`

The quality of knowledge base retrieval and generation depends on the configuration in `kb.yml`, including source file formats, data chunking strategies (e.g., by line, by paragraph), chunk overlap, retriever type, and choice of embedding models. The generation process requires some computation time; refer to the [kb-mcp-server](https://github.com/Geeksfino/kb-mcp-server) documentation for details.

## Verifying the Agent

To quickly verify that the agent is working correctly, you can use the inspector UI:

```bash
# Using the start script
bun start --inspect
# point browser to http://localhost:5173

# or with a custom port
bun start --inspect --inspect-port 3000
# point browser to http://localhost:3000

# Alternatively, you can use the cxagent command directly
bunx @finogeek/cxagent --inspect
# or
bunx @finogeek/cxagent --inspect --inspect-port 3000
```

This will open a web interface where you can see the agent's configuration, test its functionality, and ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Error about `.gitkeep` file during knowledge base building**
   ```
   Error processing file contents/.gitkeep: File format not allowed: .gitkeep
   ```
   This is a harmless warning. The `.gitkeep` file is used to ensure the `contents` directory exists in Git, but it's not a valid knowledge base document. You can safely ignore this warning.

2. **Warning about embeddings file not found during setup**
   ```
   Warning: Embeddings file not found at /path/to/kb.tar.gz
   ```
   This warning appears because the knowledge base hasn't been built yet. It will be resolved after you run `bun run kb:package`.

3. **API key issues**
   If you see errors related to API authentication, make sure you've properly configured your API key in the `.agent.env` file.

4. **Command not found errors**
   If you encounter "command not found" errors, make sure you've completed the setup process with `bun setup:env`.

5. **Knowledge base search not working**
   If `bun run kb:search` doesn't work as expected, try using the direct command:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/kb-search kb.tar.gz "your search query"
   ```

## Embedding Demo

This project includes a demo showing how to embed the FinClip chat widget in web applications. For more information, see the [embedding demo README](./embedding-demo/README.md).

You can run the embedding demo using one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using Python HTTP server (recommended)
bun run serve:python

# Using Nginx (requires Nginx to be installed)
bun run serve:nginx
```

## Knowledge Base Management

### Interactive Mode

The finclip-agent includes an interactive script for managing your knowledge base:

```bash
# Start the interactive knowledge base management tool
bun run kb:interactive
```

This tool guides you through the process of building, exporting, and searching your knowledge base with a simple menu interface. It also offers to update your MCP configuration automatically after building or exporting the knowledge base.

### Direct Commands

If you prefer direct access to the knowledge base tools, you can use these commands:

```bash
# Build the knowledge base from documents in the content directory
bun run kb:build

# Build with debug output
bun run kb:build:debug

# Search the knowledge base interactively
bun run kb:search

# Search with graph-based retrieval
bun run kb:search:graph

# Export the knowledge base for distribution
bun run kb:package
```

These commands use the configuration in `kb.yml`. After packaging the knowledge base, the `finclip.tar.gz` file will be created, which is used by the MCP server.

## Running the Agent

```bash
# Start the agent
bunx @finogeek/cxagent
```

## Embedding the Chat Widget

Create an HTML file with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Finclip Agent Chat</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Finclip Agent Chat</h1>
  
  <script 
    src="./node_modules/@finogeek/cxagent/web/dist/finclip-chat.js" 
    data-finclip-chat 
    data-api-url="http://localhost:5678" 
    data-streaming-url="http://localhost:5679"
  ></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Open this HTML file in your browser to interact with the agent.

## Project Structure

- `setup.sh`: Installs Bun, checks Python, installs uv, and sets up the environment
- `download-models.js`: Downloads required models from Hugging Face based on kb.yml
- `generate-config.js`: Generates the MCP configuration for kb-mcp-server
- `index.js`: Main script that runs all setup steps in sequence

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime (v1.0.0 or higher)
- Python 3.9+ with pip
- Internet connection for downloading models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model download fails**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you have enough disk space
   - Try running `bun run download-models` again

2. **Configuration generation fails**:
   - Make sure kb-mcp-server is installed correctly
   - Check that the virtual environment is activated

3. **Agent doesn't start**:
   - Verify your API key in `.agent.env`
   - Check that the embeddings file exists at the specified path
